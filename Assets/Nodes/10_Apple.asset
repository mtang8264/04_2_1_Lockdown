  - You walk up to the door and knock against it.
  - '"Don''t do anything stupid," Hans warns you.'
  - The door opened just a crack and you catch a glimpse of the face of a tall slender
    man.
  - You assume this is the shrill voiced man, and he slips a small round object to
    you before slamming the door once more.
  - The object turns out to be a small apple with a bite taken out.
  - You don't care and you consume the apple very quickly.
  - '"...thank you..."'
