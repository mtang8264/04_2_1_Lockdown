  - After that awkward exchange, you sit in silence for what seems like hours.
  - You feel your stomach rubbing against itself as you grow ever hungrier.
  - Some time in the afternoon, you hear a door in the hallway open and shut rather
    quickly.
  - You hear a voice outside, but it is not the gruff voice of the guard.
  - No, this voice is shriller, almost like a mouse or other small rodent.
  - '"How''s he doing in there, Hans?" the shrill man asks the guard, apparently called
    Hans.'
  - '"Hungry I think" Hans responds.'
  - '"Why don''t I give him this?" the shrill man posited.'
  - '"Umm, I think that''s against protocol..."'
  - '"But I suppose it can''t hurt."'
  - Two loud knocks come from the other side of the door before the shrill man speaks.
  - '"Come to the door." He is very demanding despite the weakness in his voice.'
  responses:
  - line: Wait at the door.
