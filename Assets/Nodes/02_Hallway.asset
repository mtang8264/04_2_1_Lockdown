  - You get out of your bed and begin for the door.
  - Surely Ms. Jones is simply running behind schedule.
  - Who knows?
  - Maybe you'll run into her just outside.
  - You are pleased by this thought, but the door does not open.
  - You push against it and it seems stuck, as if something is pressing against you.
  - A gruff voice calls from the other side of the door.
  - '"Hey! Stop that?"'
  - You can't help but response, "Who are you?"
