  - '"There was a letter on my desk last night. Did you take it?"'
  - '"No, sir," the man explains. "The investigators were here earlier and they did
    take a look around. One of them might have collected it as evidence."'
  - This made little sense to you. What about that particular letter was of such importance
    to them?
  - '"That can''t be. They left everything else just where it is."'
  - The man responds quickly, as if he had this response ready, "The system works
    the way it works."
