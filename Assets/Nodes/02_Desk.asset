  - You head to your desk, unsure of what you expect to find.
  - The desk is covered in several papers.
  - Some from work. Some from family wishing you'd come visit.
  - One things, however, stands out.
  - Or in a way it does not.
  - You notice that you can not find a letter you had received yesterday.
  - This is strange as your desk is very well organized.
  - You get on your knees to see it fell on the ground, but as you make your way down
    you stub your toe.
  - You let out a shout of pain and a gruff voice responds through the door.
  - '"Keep it down in there."'
  - You can't help but resond, "Who are you?"
